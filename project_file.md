March_Madessh api
?. Crowdsale and Crowdsale Deployer contract to buy the coins
6. Update odds every mint transaction (event) Cron Job
have a wallet for each team and transfer to winning team.
7. Use "Selection Sunday" ranking to set value expectations of each coin/team -complete
8. Publish on the internet
- authenicate into the account (sign in)
- integrate api metamask ether wallet (smart contract) and app.py
- integrate chainlink

Background info from EN website:
How many teams participate in ‘March Madness’?

32 of the 68 teams selected are “automatic bids,” meaning they won their conference tournament. The NCAA Selection Committee will choose the remaining 36 teams.

A selection committee ranks the 68 teams on “Selection Sunday,” March 12th this year, based on their regular season performance. Thereafter, four teams will be eliminated in the First Four on March 14th and 15th, leaving 64 teams in the competition. The eight teams in the First Four are the four weakest at-large bids and the four worst automatic bids.

Then, among those 64 teams, the competition is divided into four regions with 16 teams each. The regions are the East, West, South, and Midwest. Teams are rated one through 16 within their regions, determining their seed. The No.1 seed should beat the No.16 seed, theoretically.

Automatic Market Marker

Action Items:
- Mint one coin for each team [Wade, Yen]
- Determine Ranking Scale for the teams ==> use this to determine the payout odds.

- Research Automatic Market Maker/ Exchange [Adam, Faith]
(Coins on Market Marker? Eth on chain?)


Thursdays:  10CT/8PST

Additional Features:
* Payout the end of each game. 
* Offer the coins to ICO exchange.
* Trade tokens during the playoff

Goals: 
Volatiity
